Test work:
If I were to spend more time on this project, I would have used gtest to test each of the classes by themselves. Since there was only 3, I manually did the testing of buttons and Led.
Below is the lists of tests that I ran.


| tests                                                                                                            | Expected outcome                                                                                      | actual outcome                                                                                                                                                             | Pass/fail |

| LED - ensure each LED can be set from LED 1 thru 3  (happy path)                                                 | Making any led be value 1-3 will  run the program without an issue                                    | program runs fine                                                                                                                                                          | pass      |
| LED - ensure LEDs set outside of the range of 1-3 kill  the program immidiately                                  | 0 or >3 will kill the program.  (input is uint8_t)                                                    | program killed                                                                                                                                                             | pass      |
| LED - ensure the LEDs can be set to red, green, orange and off.  (happy path)                                    | Setting each of these values work.  Can be tested as part of the game.                                | program displays colours correctly                                                                                                                                         | pass      |
| LED - Any other value of Led fails and kills the program                                                         | any value that is not the list of  given colours kills the program                                    | program killed                                                                                                                                                             | pass      |
| BUTTON - When a, s, or d is pressed, it returns with the correct button ID a, b, or c respectively. (happy path) | returns the key selected. This feature is required to play the game. Tested as  part of the black box | Game works by keys being pressed properly                                                                                                                                  | pass      |
| BUTTON - When any other key is pressed, it returns the a  "Button escape" key that kills the program.            | the program states that an invalid key has  been pressed and then kills the program.                  | program killed                                                                                                                                                             | pass      |
| GAME - in debug mode, see what the pattern is. Guess that  pattern in the correct order.                         | With pattern A, B, C. type in 'a', 's', 'd'                                                           | Game is won and a new pattern is given. LEDs are all off now.                                                                                                              | pass      |
| GAME - in debug mode, see what the pattern is. Ensure orange and  red leds are triggered with bad inputs.        | With pattern A, B, B type in 's', 's', 'd'                                                            | The game shows "orange    green   red"                                                                                                                                     | pass      |
| GAME - in debug mode, see what the pattern is. Guess a pattern that does not match the game winning one.         | With pattern A, B, C type in 'a', 'a', 'a'                                                            | Game shows "green    orange   orange" and  the game is lost. Pressing another key will continue the game with the same pattern.                                            | pass      |
| GAME - in debug mode, when guessing a pattern, ensure the leds are  displayed from the right                     | With any pattern besides A, A, A, type 'a', 'a', 'a'                                                  | After the first input, LED 3 should show any colour After the second input, LED 2 and 3 should show any colour After the last input, LED 1, 2 and 3 should show any colour | pass      |
