 - ensure each LED can only be set to LED 1 thru 3
 - ensure each button can only be set to A, B or c
 - Any other input quits out of the game
 - the screen shows the last loss colours when retrying the sequence
 - the screen shows 3 off leds when a win occurs
 - add a test mode that prints the sequence to guess for testing purposes
